The grunt imagecheck task is a task to compress and trim images. All initial images should be placed within a _source-images folder. The images should be arranged into two subdirectories, medium-images and big-images. The task is run with the command grunt imagecheck. The task scales the images within the big folder to a width of 1920px and the images in the medium folder to width of 720px. All images have their quality degraded to 70%. The task will then crop the big images to a height of 1064px and the medium images to a height of 460px. The newly processed images are moved to the /assets/images directory, with the task creating the subdirectories big-images and medium-images if they do not already exist. If tggrunthese subdirectories already exist and contain images that have the same name as the newly processed images, the task will overwrite the existing images to the processed version.

This is a grunt task so it should be placed in the gruntfile of the website. It requires the "grunt-image-resize", "grunt-resize-crop", and "grunt-responsive-images" dependencies to be added to the package.json of the website. Running the command npm install should then install these dependencies.
